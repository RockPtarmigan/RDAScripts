#README In this section we will be attempting to append climate data onto our main data frame
#WorldClim has been identified as the best resource for pulling down this data. 
#
#First set the working directory and load the libraries
#

setwd("C:/ForR")
library(sp)
library(raster)

# Pull in the csv file coordinates to work from
#

mutacoords <- read.csv(file = "muta_coords.csv")
head(mutacoords)

#convert just the coordinates to a spatial points data frame, ((we're passing coords as a standin to identify xy in the coord = argument)). 
#

crds <- mutacoords[c("Long","Lat")]
spdf <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(coords = crds, data = crds, proj4string = CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0"))

#The source information for the data will be stored in variable r, note we've established a resolution of 10 here ((*****FIND OUT WHAT THIS MEANS*****))
#

r <- getData("worldclim",var="bio",res=10)

#19 different options are available but we're going to take mean annual temperature and precipitation [1 and 12 respectively] to pull ((List of options here: https://www.worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html))
#

r <- r[[c(1, 6, 12, 19)]]
names(r) <- c("Temp","LowT","Prec","Snow")

#Execute to pull data into a combined dataframe
#

values <- extract(r,spdf)
df <- cbind.data.frame(coordinates(spdf),values)
head(df)

#Note that temperature data is *10 of actual value in celcius for data transfer efficiency (removing decimal points is much easier.) so df["Temp"] <- df["Temp"]*0.1 will show the accurate value
#This will need to be repeated for any temperature variable used if you choose to correct it.
