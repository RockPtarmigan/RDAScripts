#This bash script will use version 1.9 of the PLINK program to take the VCF snp files and turn them into .raw files for reading into the redundancy analysis pipeline.
#Most useful information related to this methodology is going to be found here: https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats#raw
#


#An output directory for the results (our .raw file outputs) will need to be developed 
#Pull location:
#Push location:

mkdir 

#The location of the VCF files on the rackham server is where the read section will go, so that will need to be defined - Or we can just manually detail each conversion
#into the new directory
