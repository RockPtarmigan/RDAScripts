#As the SNP cleaning runs, in columns where the number of most common vectors are tied, the lowest common vector will be chosen
#For example, in tests where 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0 and any number of NAs are present, the value zero will be selected to replace NAs regardless of arrangement of values.
